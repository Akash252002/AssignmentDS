The purpose of the validation set is to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance while it is being trained.\\n\\nTest Set: The test set is a subset of the dataset used to evaluate the performance of the final model. The test set is used to estimate how well the model is likely to perform on new, unseen data.\\n\\nThe importance of each of these sets is as follows:\\n\\nTraining set: The training set is used to fit the model and learn the underlying patterns in the data. It is important to have a large and representative training set to ensure that the model learns the most relevant patterns and can generalize well to new data.\\n\\nValidation set: The validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model during training. It is important to have a validation set to monitor the model's performance and make sure it is not overfitting the training data. Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor performance on new data.\\n\\nTest set: The test set is used to evaluate the performance of the final model. It is important to have a separate test set to estimate the model's performance on new, unseen data. If the model performs well on the test set, it is likely to perform well on new data in the real world.\\n\\nOverall, the train-test-validation split is important in machine learning to ensure that the model is trained on the most representative and relevant data, and that its performance is evaluated objectively and accurately.\""
