K-means clustering works by iteratively assigning data points to the cluster with the closest mean, until the assignments no longer change.\n",
        "Density-based clustering algorithms identify clusters based on areas of high density in the data. One of the most well-known density-based clustering algorithms is DBSCAN. DBSCAN works by identifying clusters as areas of high density that are surrounded by areas of low density.\n",

One of the most well-known distribution-based clustering algorithms is Gaussian mixture models. Gaussian mixture models assume that the data points in each cluster follow a Gaussian (normal) distribution.\n",
        "Hierarchical clustering algorithms build a hierarchy of clusters, starting with each data point as its own cluster. The clusters are then merged together based on their similarity, until there is only one cluster left. One of the most well-known hierarchical clustering algorithms is agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering works by merging the two most similar clusters together at each step.\n",

Partitioning clustering algorithms are the simplest to understand and implement, but they can be sensitive to the choice of the number of clusters. Density-based clustering algorithms are more robust to the choice of the number of clusters, but they can be more computationally expensive. Distribution-based clustering algorithms make strong assumptions about the data, but they can be very accurate if the assumptions are met. Hierarchical clustering algorithms are a flexible approach that can be used to find a variety of cluster structures, but they can be difficult to interpret.\n",
