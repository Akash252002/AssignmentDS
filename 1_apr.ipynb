Overfitting occurs when the model fits the noise in the training data rather than the underlying patterns, which leads to poor generalization performance.\n",

This method can handle interactions between features, but it can be computationally expensive for large datasets.\n",

For example, in medical diagnosis, the number of patients with a rare disease may be much lower than the number of healthy patients. Handling imbalanced datasets in logistic regression requires special techniques to ensure that the model does not learn to favor the majority class and instead achieves a balance between both classes. Here are some strategies for dealing with class imbalance:\n",

Underfitting can be addressed by increasing the complexity of the model, such as by adding more features, using a more flexible model, or increasing the number of iterations during training.\n",
