        "Anomaly detection is the identification of rare items, events or observations which deviate significantly from the majority of the data and do not conform to a well defined notion of normal behaviour. Such examples may arouse suspicions of being generated by a different mechanism, or appear inconsistent with the remainder of that set of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Anomaly detection finds application in many domains including cyber security, medicine, machine vision, statistics, neuroscience, law enforcement and financial fraud to name only a few. Anomalies were initially searched for clear rejection or omission from the data to aid statistical analysis, for example to compute the mean or standard deviation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Anomaly detection is a powerful tool that can be used to identify problems early on, before they cause major damage. For example, in the healthcare industry, anomaly detection can be used to identify patients who are at risk of developing a serious condition. In the financial industry, anomaly detection can be used to identify fraudulent transactions. And in the manufacturing industry, anomaly detection can be used to identify equipment that is about to fail.\n",
