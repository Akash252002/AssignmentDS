              "'\\nUsing Elastic Net Regression for Feature Selection:\\n\\nElastic Net Regression can be used for feature selection by setting the regularization parameter alpha \\nto a value that shrinks some of the coefficients to zero (L1 regularization)\\nThe resulting model will only include the predictor variables with non-zero coefficients, effectively performing feature selection\\nThe degree of feature selection is controlled by the value of alpha, with larger values resulting in more sparsity \\n(fewer non-zero coefficients) and stronger regularization\\nThe value of alpha can be selected using cross-validation, where the optimal value is the one that minimizes \\nthe prediction error on a held-out validation dataset\\nThe L1 regularization in Elastic Net Regression is particularly useful for high-dimensional datasets with many correlated predictors, \\nwhere traditional feature selection methods such as stepwise regression may not perform well\\nThe L2 regularization in Elastic Net Regression can also help to reduce the variance of the estimated coefficients and improve the \\nstability of the feature selection process\\nIt is important to assess the impact of feature selection on the results of Elastic Net Regression and to report any limitations \\nand assumptions made in the analysis\\nOverall, Elastic Net Regression provides a powerful tool for feature selection in high-dimensional datasets, and the choice of \\nthe regularization parameter alpha can be used to control the degree of sparsity and regularization. Cross-validation is a useful \\ntechnique for selecting the optimal value of alpha and assessing the impact of feature selection on the results.'"
