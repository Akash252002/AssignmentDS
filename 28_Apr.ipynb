        "Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups unlabeled data points into clusters. It is different from other clustering techniques in that it creates a hierarchy of clusters, rather than a single, flat set of clusters. This hierarchy can be represented as a dendrogram, which is a tree-like structure that shows the relationships between the clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main types of hierarchical clustering: agglomerative and divisive. Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point in its own cluster, and then merges clusters that are similar to each other. Divisive clustering starts with all the data points in a single cluster, and then splits clusters that are dissimilar to each other.\n",

        "Hierarchical clustering is a versatile algorithm that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as customer segmentation, document classification, and image segmentation. It is particularly well-suited for tasks where the number of clusters is unknown or where the clusters may have different shapes or sizes.\n",
