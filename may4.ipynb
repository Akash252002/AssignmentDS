        "A time series is a sequence of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n",
        "\n",
        "Time series are used in statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition, econometrics, mathematical finance, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction, electroencephalography, control engineering, astronomy, communications engineering, and largely in any domain of applied science and engineering which involves temporal measurements. Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.\n",

        "Some common applications of time series analysis include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Forecasting:** Time series analysis can be used to forecast future values of a time series. This is useful in a variety of settings, such as predicting stock prices, sales, or weather.\n",
        "* **Identifying trends:** Time series analysis can be used to identify trends in a time series. This can be helpful for understanding how a variable is changing over time and for making predictions about the future.\n",
        "* **Detecting outliers:** Time series analysis can be used to detect outliers in a time series. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. They can be caused by errors or by unusual events.\n",
        "* **Understanding seasonality:** Time series analysis can be used to understand seasonality in a time series. Seasonality is the tendency for a time series to have regular fluctuations over time. This can be caused by factors such as the weather or the calendar.\n",
        "* **Improving the quality of data:** Time series analysis can be used to improve the quality of data. This can be done by identifying and removing outliers, by correcting for seasonality, and by smoothing the data.\n",

Cyclicity can be identified by looking for longer-term fluctuations in the data that do not repeat over a regular period of time.\n",

        "Once a time series pattern has been identified, it can be interpreted to gain insights into the underlying causes of the data. For example, if a time series shows a trend, it may be interpreted as evidence that the underlying variable is changing over time. If a time series shows seasonality, it may be interpreted as evidence that the underlying variable is affected by seasonal factors such as the weather or the calendar. If a time series shows cyclicity, it may be interpreted as evidence that the underlying variable is affected by cyclical factors such as economic cycles or political cycles.\n",
