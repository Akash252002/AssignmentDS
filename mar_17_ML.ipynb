This improves the performance of the model and reduces the risk of overfitting on the minority class.\\n\\nIn summary, data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of a dataset by creating new samples from the existing ones. \\nSMOTE is a type of data augmentation used to handle imbalanced datasets by generating new synthetic samples for the minority class using interpolation\\n\""
