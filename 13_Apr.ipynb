        "Random Forest Regressor is a machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make a more accurate prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "In a random forest regressor, a set of decision trees are trained on different subsets of the input data, with different subsets of the features selected for each tree. During training, each tree is built using a random subset of the input data and a random subset of the input features. This randomness helps to reduce overfitting, which can occur when a single decision tree is too complex and fits the noise in the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "During prediction, the random forest regressor combines the predictions of the individual decision trees to make a final prediction. The final prediction is typically the average of the predictions from all the trees. The random forest regressor is a powerful and flexible algorithm that can be used for a wide range of regression tasks, including predicting continuous variables such as stock prices or housing prices."

        "\n",
        "Random Subsets of Features: Random Forest Regressor selects a random subset of features from the available features to build each decision tree. This means that each tree is trained on a different set of features, reducing the correlation between the trees and helping to reduce overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bootstrapped Samples: Random Forest Regressor uses bootstrapped samples to train each decision tree. A bootstrapped sample is a random subset of the training data, drawn with replacement. This means that each decision tree is trained on a slightly different subset of the data, helping to reduce overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ensemble Learning: Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees. By averaging the predictions of many trees, the final prediction is less likely to be influenced by noise in the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regularization: Each decision tree in a Random Forest Regressor is typically grown to its maximum depth, but the algorithm includes a regularization parameter that controls the number of features and samples used in each split. This helps to prevent the trees from becoming too deep and overfitting the training data.\n",
