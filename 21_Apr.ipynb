        "The main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance metric lies in how they measure the distance between two points in a multidimensional space.\n",
        "\n",
        "Euclidean distance is calculated as the straight-line distance between two points, considering the square root of the sum of squared differences between their coordinates. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:\n",

        "The main effect of this difference on the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor is the way they define proximity and influence the neighbor selection process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Euclidean distance takes into account both the magnitude and the direction of the differences between coordinates. It is sensitive to the scale of the features and assumes a spherical distribution of the data points. If the features have different scales, the dimensions with larger ranges may dominate the distance calculation. This can cause problems if some features are more informative than others or if the data is not well-scaled. Euclidean distance tends to work well when the underlying data follows a Gaussian distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Manhattan distance, on the other hand, only considers the absolute differences between coordinates. It measures the distance based on the number of blocks a person would have to walk horizontally and vertically to reach from one point to another in a city grid. Manhattan distance is more robust to variations in feature scales since it treats all dimensions equally. It works well when the underlying data has a uniform distribution or when there are categorical features involved.\n",

        "The choice between Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance depends on the nature of the data and the problem at hand. If the features have similar scales and there are no categorical variables, Euclidean distance can be a good choice. However, if the features have different scales or there are categorical variables, Manhattan distance might be a better option.\n",

        "This approach can be useful when labeling new data is expensive or time-consuming.\n",
        "Optimizing the size of the training set requires a careful analysis of the available data, model performance, and the resources and constraints of the problem.
