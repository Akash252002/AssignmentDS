        "Decision tree classifier is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by creating a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. Each node in the tree represents a decision based on a feature and its possible outcomes. The final outcomes are represented by the leaves of the tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm starts by selecting the feature that provides the most information gain, which means the feature that splits the data into subsets with the highest possible homogeneity. This feature is used to create the first decision node of the tree. The data is then split into two or more subsets based on the outcomes of this decision.\n",
        "\n",
        "The algorithm continues to recursively split the data into subsets based on the features that provide the most information gain until a stopping criterion is met. This stopping criterion could be a predefined maximum depth of the tree or a minimum number of samples required to split a node.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the tree is constructed, it can be used to classify new data by following the decisions from the root node to a leaf node. At each decision node, the value of the corresponding feature is compared to the split value of the node. The data is then directed to the left or right child node, depending on whether the feature value is less than or greater than the split value. This process continues until a leaf node is reached, which provides the final classification result.\n",

        "Decision tree classifier has several advantages, including easy interpretation, ability to handle both categorical and numerical data, and can capture non-linear relationships between features. However, it can also suffer from overfitting and instability, especially with noisy or incomplete data.\n"
