        "An ensemble technique in machine learning is a method that combines the predictions of multiple models (called base or weak learners) to produce a final prediction that is typically more accurate and robust than any of the individual models. Ensembles can be used for both classification and regression problems and can be created using different approaches, such as bagging, boosting, or stacking. The goal of ensemble learning is to reduce the variance and/or bias of the predictions of individual models, leading to improved accuracy and robustness."

        "Improved accuracy: By combining the predictions of multiple models, ensembles can often achieve higher accuracy than any single model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Robustness: Ensembles can be more robust to noise or outliers in the data, as errors in individual models are often offset by the predictions of other models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reduction of overfitting: Ensembles can reduce the risk of overfitting, where a model becomes too complex and fits the training data too closely, by combining simpler models or using regularization techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "Better generalization: Ensembles can improve the generalization of a model, allowing it to perform well on new, unseen data, by reducing the risk of overfitting and capturing more information from the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility: Ensembles can be used with a variety of base models and techniques, allowing them to be applied to a wide range of problems and data types.\n",

        "Bagging, or Bootstrap Aggregation, is an ensemble technique in machine learning that combines the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of the training data. The basic idea of bagging is to create multiple bootstrap samples of the original training data by randomly selecting examples with replacement. Each bootstrap sample is used to train a different model, often using the same learning algorithm and hyperparameters, but with different subsets of the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the prediction phase, the output of each model is combined to obtain a final prediction. This can be done by taking the average or majority vote of the predictions, depending on whether the problem is regression or classification, respectively. The idea behind bagging is that by combining models trained on different subsets of the data, it is possible to reduce the variance of the predictions and improve the overall performance of the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bagging can be used with any base model, but is particularly effective with models that have high variance, such as decision trees. One example of a bagging algorithm is Random Forest, which combines multiple decision trees trained on different subsets of the data using bagging and random feature selection."

        "Boosting is an ensemble technique in machine learning that combines the predictions of multiple weak learners (simple models that perform only slightly better than random guessing) to create a strong learner (a more accurate and powerful model). Unlike bagging, boosting focuses on improving the bias of the model, rather than reducing variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea of boosting is to train a series of models sequentially, with each subsequent model trying to correct the errors of the previous one. During training, examples that are misclassified by the current model are given greater weight, so that subsequent models focus more on these examples. This approach emphasizes the hard-to-classify examples, making it possible to build a more accurate model.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final prediction of a boosted model is typically a weighted combination of the predictions of all the models in the ensemble. Boosting can be used with any base model, but is often used with decision trees or other weak learners that can be trained quickly and are resistant to overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "One example of a boosting algorithm is AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting), which assigns higher weights to misclassified examples and lower weights to correctly classified examples. Another example is Gradient Boosting, which uses a similar approach but instead of assigning weights, it trains subsequent models to predict the difference between the predicted output and the true output of the previous model."

The most commonly used confidence interval is the \"bootstrap percentile method\", which involves taking the lower and upper percentiles that correspond to the desired confidence level (e.g. 95%). For example, to calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean, we would take the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the distribution of means across the bootstrap samples.\n",
