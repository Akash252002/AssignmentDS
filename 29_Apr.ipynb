        "The code then creates a DBSCAN object and fits it to the data. The `fit()` method of the DBSCAN object clusters the data and assigns each point to a cluster. The `labels_` attribute of the DBSCAN object stores the cluster labels for each point.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the code plots the data with the cluster labels. The plot shows that the data has been clustered into two clusters. The first cluster contains the points that are located in the upper left corner of the plot. The second cluster contains the points that are located in the lower right corner of the plot.\n",
        "\n",
        "The meaning of the obtained clusters can be interpreted by looking at the data points that are assigned to each cluster. The first cluster contains the points that are located in the upper left corner of the plot. These points are all located near each other and have similar values. This suggests that they may belong to the same group or class. The second cluster contains the points that are located in the lower right corner of the plot. These points are also located near each other and have similar values. This suggests that they may also belong to the same group or class.\n",

        "The DBSCAN algorithm is a powerful clustering algorithm that can be used to find clusters in data of any density. It is robust to outliers and can handle datasets with noise or missing values. The algorithm can be implemented in a variety of programming languages, including Python."
